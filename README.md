## Description
This is our Capstone project.  In it we will compile a mobile application that functions as a phonebook for extension-based phone systems.  The app will provide a searchable, indexed list of numbers callable from inside the app, which will be loaded from a list supplied by some third party, so that any organization will be able to use our app to provide a phonebook to whomever may need it.

## TO DO
* Scrollable List
* Framework for loading list of names with attributes
* Calling from inside app
* Searching numbers by name (e.g. type "Sar" returns all names including "sar")
* Searching numbers by Department/other attributes (Give end-users the ability to "sort" numbers into groups that can be looked through)
