This is our Capstone project.  In it we will compile a mobile application that functions as a phonebook for extension-based phone systems.  The app will provide a searchable, indexed list of numbers callable from inside the app, which will be loaded from a list supplied by some third party, so that any organization will be able to use our app to provide a phonebook to whomever may need it.
